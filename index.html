    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>
I didn't have a clear plan before I started this task and wasn't sure how to go. After looking through the reference file, I understood where to begin. My strategy progressively became more clear as I worked on the task, and things went more smoothly.</p>
    
    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>
Progressive Enhancement might seem like a regular thing now, but it's actually had quite the journey to get here. Back in the day, there was this other concept called graceful degradation. It was all about making sure a website at least kinda worked, even if it wasn't at its best. But then along came Progressive Enhancement, which changed the game. Instead of just making things passable, it focused on building a solid foundation that worked for everyone, no matter what device or browser they were using.</p>
