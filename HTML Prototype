          <h4>Reason Why Michael Jordan is Better</h4>
            <blockquote>Michael Jordan's scoring abilities are legendary, distinguishing him as one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history. Jordan won the scoring title ten times and has the highest career scoring average in NBA history, at 30.1 points per game. His ability to dominate games with his scoring, especially in crunch time, is often regarded as unequaled. Jordan's defensive influence is widely seen as superior than that of LeBron James. Jordan was a fierce defender who made several NBA All-Defensive Team appearances. His ability to lock down opponents, especially in crucial moments, was critical to the Bulls' success. While LeBron James is a decent defender, Michael Jordan's defensive accolades and reputation as one of the best two-way players in basketball history give him the advantage in this comparison. Jordan's influence extended beyond the basketball court, making him a global legend. His collaboration with Nike created the famous Air Jordan brand, which transcended basketball and became a cultural sensation.</q></blockquote>
